### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer who loves to experiment with crafting tech-based solutions and share with others my learning process. Currently, I am maintaining NEMU, a visual programming environment web-app, to assist people in learning fundamental programming concepts. Outside my work, I participate in various events held by the university, government institution, and tech community to present talks and workshops on software development and startups topics.
